# Symphony v2

Dynamic sub-agent creation and orchestration system.

## Usage

```bash
uv run src/main.py --task "Create a comprehensive business proposal for an airline focused on connecting China and the West Coast of the US. Consider the ideaâ€™s financial viability, any potential legal challenges, the state of the market, and brand building potential." --output_path "results/airline.md"
```

## Roadmap

- [ ] Add selective passing of context from sub-agents to the next, based on orchestrator
- [ ] Dynamically pick from library at the beginning, create new ones on the fly (generalization is even more imoprtant)
- [ ] Orchestrator gives feedback to the agents so they improve over time, one agent retains all of its memory
- [ ] Tool calling and data builds naturally on that
