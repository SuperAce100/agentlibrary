      "[2025-05-02T09:09:02.122815+00:00] The stub function and imports are solid, with proper dimension checks and exception handling. You covered the core use cases\u2014CSR\u00d7dense and dense\u00d7CSR\u2014but the second test is flawed: those shapes are compatible, so no `ValueError` would actually be raised. The sample output compounds this by showing an error where there shouldn\u2019t be one. To improve, correct the test expectations for the mixed-order multiplication, show the real result of `A_dense.dot(B_csr)`, and update the sample output accordingly. This will ensure full alignment between tests, code behavior, and documented output."
