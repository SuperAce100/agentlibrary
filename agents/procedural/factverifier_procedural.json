      "[2025-05-02T16:44:22.553970+00:00] The FactVerifier produced a concise yet comprehensive verification report, systematically checking every numeric range, diagnostic rule, and source citation against authoritative references. The structure is clear, and correctness statuses are unambiguous. The only minor shortcoming is the absence of precise page or section numbers from the cited manuals, which would strengthen source support validity. Otherwise, the report fully complies with instructions and adds valuable recommendations for enhancing citation specificity."
