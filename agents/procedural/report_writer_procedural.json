      "[2025-05-10T21:02:28.527897+00:00] The report is professionally structured, mathematically precise, and addresses all major components of the task. The use of clear headings, accurate tables, and a boxed final result make the document highly readable. To further polish the report, include numbered equations as specified and present the bibliography in a standard, numbered reference list. Other than these minor stylistic points, the report fully satisfies the requirements."
