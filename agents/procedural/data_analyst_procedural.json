      "[2025-05-07T19:27:51.544393+00:00] The Data Analyst has delivered a largely precise, well\u2010organized quantitative synthesis aligned with the instructions. Tables are clear, visualizations are well described, and statistical computations are transparent and accurate. The only shortcoming is that some data points (e.g., vertebrate species counts) appear to be approximated beyond the original raw summary. For full fidelity, ensure that all extracted metrics strictly derive from the provided context or clearly label any additional estimates as such. Otherwise, the output is professional, comprehensive, and ready to inform the next conservation\u00adrecommendation phase."
