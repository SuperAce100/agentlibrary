      "[2025-05-07T19:26:20.244298+00:00] The Information Researcher delivered a well-structured, region-wise compilation that aligns closely with the instructions. Citations are complete and URLs are provided, and the assistant clearly indicates willingness to expand with detailed tables. To improve further, include more quantitative projections for the Congo Basin and Southeast Asia, and briefly restate or acknowledge the original request to demonstrate full alignment with user instructions."
