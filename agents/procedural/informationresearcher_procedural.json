      "[2025-05-10T22:31:42.290079+00:00] This is an excellent high-quality response that fully and clearly fulfills the instructions given to the InformationResearcher. It systematically covers all requested points with mathematical accuracy and clear reasoning, providing a detailed and precise exposition suitable for guiding the next stages of the task. The explanation of why the integral is zero without supplementary classes is especially important and well-presented. The inclusion of references and computational tools gives both theoretical and practical depth. Overall, this response forms a strong foundation for the MathematicsExpert Agent to perform any necessary computations or deductions."
