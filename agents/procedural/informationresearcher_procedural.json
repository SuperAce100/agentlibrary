      "[2025-05-10T20:57:04.874405+00:00] The response admirably follows the formatting and sourcing instructions and integrates the two data sets to facilitate the next step. However, there are notable errors in some of the homology and bordism entries that must be verified or corrected before proceeding. Once those data points are checked against primary references, this material will be a solid foundation for the spectral-sequence computation."
