      "[2025-05-02T08:42:41.915782+00:00] The InformationResearcher delivered a highly structured, comprehensive synthesis that aligns closely with the instructions. Strengths include clear regional segmentation, authoritative citations, numeric estimates for temperature and biodiversity metrics, and explicit reliability assessments. Case studies are well chosen and sourced. To enhance completeness, consider adding specific precipitation change values (e.g., mm/year changes) and expanding on sub-regional variability where data permit. Overall, this response forms a robust foundation for the downstream analysis and recommendation phases."
