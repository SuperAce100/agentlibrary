      "[2025-05-10T21:00:36.599483+00:00] This write-up impeccably follows the instructions, presenting a coherent and detailed explanation of the AHSS computation, extension analysis, and reduction to the final result. The structure, tables, and LaTeX formatting make it both readable and precise. The final boxed statement and clear reference list complete the professional presentation. No revisions are needed."
