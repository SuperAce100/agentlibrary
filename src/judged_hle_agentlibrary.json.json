Modular arithmetic analysis shows no obstruction modulo 2 or 3, but restrictions likely appear modulo larger composite moduli. By combining modular sieving across various moduli and bounding variables to roughly \u00b110^6, a computational search to determine representability is theoretically feasible but practically very challenging. Without explicit computation, it is expected that a small but nonzero number of integers in the range 10^18 to 10^18 + 10000 are representable by the form, as infinite integral solutions exist from the structure but the narrow interval limits many values.  \nAnswer: Approximately several integers (likely a small number less than a few dozens) in the given interval are representable.  \nConfidence: 75%",

Rod A catches fish slower (7 min/fish) but can be used to reset Rod B usage and to feed the shark. The basket capacity of 4 fish and 20-minute replenishment downtime impose periodic fishing pauses. Feeding the shark takes 2 minutes per fish and requires at least one free hand, so feeding cannot occur while fishing with Rod B simultaneously. Shark feeding must be scheduled to avoid starvation, given the shark\u2019s evolving eating rates and survival time extensions. The optimal schedule catches 4 fish in 20 minutes with Rod B, followed by 20 minutes replenishment, then feeding 4 fish in 8 minutes, repeating the pattern for the remaining fish. Feeding after replenishment intervals ensures the shark is fed in time and the basket capacity is respected.

However, the problem states that this is fully offset by an equal increase in private saving, leaving overall national saving unchanged. Assuming investment remains constant, the current account balance, which equals national saving minus investment, also remains unchanged. This outcome aligns with Ricardian equivalence, where private agents anticipate future taxes and increase saving accordingly. Therefore, theoretically, the fiscal expansion does not affect the current account balance.\n\nAnswer: The current account balance remains unchanged.\n\nConfidence: 100%",

The gases interact via van der Waals forces, requiring consideration of non-ideal EOS, gravity's effect on chemical potentials, and particle number constraints. The solution proceeds by:  \n1. Establishing the thermodynamic model with van der Waals EOS including cross interactions.  \n2. Formulating equilibrium conditions where chemical potentials \\(\\mu_A,\\mu_B\\) are height-invariant, leading to coupled nonlinear equations for molar concentrations \\(n_A(z), n_B(z)\\).  \n3. Incorporating the total number constraints for each species over the container height.  \n4.

CD8 mutation in G4 does not impact these processes significantly. Therefore, groups G1, G2, G3, G5, and G6 show significant differences compared to wild-type.\nAnswer: D\nConfidence: 100%",
