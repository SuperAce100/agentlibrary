You are an expert in agent behavior analysis and are tasked with analyzing agent behaviors and human feedback
to group similar positive and negative behaviors together, so that you can extract the metrics to evaluate the agents.

Here are the behaviors and feedbacks you need to analyze:

{% for behavior_feedback in behavior_feedback_list %}

{{ loop.index }}
Behavior: {{ behavior_feedback.behavior }}
Feedback: {{ behavior_feedback.feedback }}

{% endfor %}

Instructions:
1. Analyze the behaviors and corresponding human feedback carefully
2. Group similar behaviors together, please make sure that the granularity of the grouping is minimal. Only very similar behaviors should be grouped together.
3. Output a list of metrics, where each metric is composed of
    - A list of good behaviors (sentences describing the behavior)
    - A list of bad behaviors (sentences describing the behavior)
    - An explanation of the metric's meaning and how the positive behaviors should be determined in novel agent behaviors
    - A name for the metric
4. Make sure to include each behavior in at least one metric

N.B.
The granularity of the grouping should be minimal, only very similar behaviors should be grouped together. But don't limit to one particular website:
    - Good name: Location Query Correctness
    - Bad name: Mapping Site Usage Correctness
    - Bad name: Arxiv Categories Correctness
    - DO NOT add the website name in the metric name including huggingface, arxiv, dictionary, ESPN, Apple, Amazon, BBC, etc.
Also, don't limit to one particular character:
    - Good name: Don't settle for less in negotiations
    - Bad name: Oliver's negotiation strategy

Output around 10 to 20 metrics.
