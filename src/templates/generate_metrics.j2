You are an expert evaluator tasked with analyzing agent trajectories and human feedback to identify and define relevant evaluation metrics.

Context:
Review the following interactions between an AI agent and a human, along with the corresponding human feedback for each interaction.

{% for instance in instances %}
Instance {{ loop.index }}:

Agent Trajectory:
{{ instance.trajectory }}

Human Feedback:
{{ instance.feedback }}

{% endfor %}

Instructions:
1. Analyze the agent trajectories and corresponding human feedback carefully
2. Identify key aspects of performance that emerge from the interactions and feedback
3. Define a comprehensive set of metrics that capture these aspects
4. For each metric provide:
   - A clear name
   - A detailed description of what the metric measures
   - Why this metric is important based on the observed interactions
   - Example behaviors from the trajectories that would score high or low on this metric

Output the following:

Identified Metrics:
[List each metric in the following format]

1. Metric Name: [Concise, descriptive name]
   Description: [Clear explanation of what this metric measures]
   Importance: [Why this metric matters based on the trajectories and feedback]
   Examples:
   - High Score Example: [Behavior that would exemplify high performance]
   - Low Score Example: [Behavior that would indicate poor performance]

2. [Continue for each identified metric...]

Justification:
[Explain how these metrics together provide comprehensive coverage of the important aspects of performance demonstrated in the trajectories and highlighted by the human feedback]

Additional Considerations:
[Note any context-specific factors that might affect metric applicability or interpretation]
